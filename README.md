# Using Pybudget

Pybudget is currently incompatible with Windows and must be ran on a Linux distro. 

After installing the requirements, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the 
script to in the terminal and enter the following commands:

1. chmod +x pybudget
2. ./pybudget \<your paycheck or total income for the pay period without the dollar sign \>
3. The above command will prompt the script to make two files for you (config and expenses). Fill them as you're told by the bot.
4. Press the up arrow on your keyboard to get the command in the second step, press enter.
5. Enjoy a budget according to your specifications!
